|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ExternalUserService`     | Core class library with client/service/models|

--------------------------------------------------------- Design Explanation  --------------------------------------------------------------
1) Separate models, services, and exceptions, so each piece can have a single responsibility.
2) Used HttpClient and IOptions<UserServiceOptions> via constructor â€” this makes the service easily testable and DI-ready.
3) Added custom exceptions for clean error handling (ExternalApiException, NetworkException).
4) Simple in-memory caching added to simulate real scenarios.
